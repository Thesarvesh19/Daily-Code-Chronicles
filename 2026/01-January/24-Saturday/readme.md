# Minimize Maximum Pair Sum in Array

## Problem
You are given an even-length array `nums`.  
Pair the elements such that:
- Each element is used exactly once
- The **maximum pair sum** is minimized

Return the minimized maximum pair sum.

---

## Approach
1. Sort the array
2. Pair the smallest element with the largest element
3. Track the maximum sum among all pairs

This greedy approach ensures the pair sums are balanced.
